This project was done in the [Environmental Genomics][envgen] group at [SciLifeLab][scilife]. Our project aim was to explore ways to identify microbes in metagenomic samples with the possibility of recreating their genomes. To do this we used information found in the composition of contigs in these samples and their coverage across samples to cluster the contigs into species and strain level clusters. Our project resulted in the program [CONCOCT (github)][concoct-repo] and an article published in [Nature Methods][concoct-paper], where I was co-first author under supervision of [Anders Andersson][anders].

My [thesis][binni-thesis] was published in 2017 and I [presented][binni-pres] then as well.
